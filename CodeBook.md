Getting and Cleaning Data Project
====================

Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data class

This folder contains a file of the run_analysis.R file which contains the R script for reading in the Smartphone experimental data file and creating a new tidy data set.  

The tidy data set was uploaded as a text file on the Coursera website for this class. The "tidyDataSmart.text" file was created as a tab delimited file (sep = "\t") using the write.table function.
